%% Part 1. Least Significant Bit Data Hiding
%{
Write a Matlab function that extracts and displays a user specified bit 
plane from an image. Use this function to examine each of the bit planes 
in the peppers.tif and baboon.tif images. As you examine progressively
lower bit planes, you should notice that each bit plane increasingly 
resembles noise.
